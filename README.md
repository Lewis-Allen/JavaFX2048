# JavaFX 2048

The popular game 2048 implemented using JavaFX.

## ToDo
- Refactor move method in controller. Lots of repetition can be easily cleaned up.
- Rework color generation. Colours changes are very subtle early on due to linear interpolation.
- Remove grid and add animations.
- Mini SQLite DB for scores (Maybe?)
